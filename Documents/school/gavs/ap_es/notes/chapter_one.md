# Introduction to Environmental Science

## Key Terms

Primary Air Pollutants: produced by humans & nature (CO, CO 2 , SO 2 , NO, hydrocarbons, particulates).

Particulate Matter: sources include burning fossil fuels and car exhaust. Effects include reduced visibility, respiratory irritation. Methods of reduction include filtering, electrostatic precipitators, alternative energy).

Ozone: Secondary pollutant, NO 2 + UV 1 NO + O; O + O 2 1 O 3 , with VOCs. O3 causes respiratory irritation and plant damage. Reduced by reducing NO emissions and VOCs.

Sulfur Oxides: (SO x ) Primary source is coal burning. Primary and secondary effects include acid deposition, respiratory irritation, plant damage. Reduction methods include: scrubbers, burn low sulfur fuel.

Carbon Dioxide: (CO 2 ) Sources include the combustion of fossil fuels. Effects: greenhouse gas- contributes to global warming. Reduction accomplished by increased fuel efficiency (gas mileage), mass transit (reduction).

Ozone Depletion: caused by CFCs, methyl chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, halon, methyl bromide all of which attack stratospheric ozone. Negative effects of ozone depletion include increased UV, skin cancer, cataracts, and decreased plant growth.  

Greenhouse Gases: Most significant: H 2 O, CO 2 , methane (CH 4 ), CFCs. Trap outgoing infrared energy (heat) causing earth to warm.

Greenhouse Effect: a vital process, required for life to exist on Earth. If accelerated, bad, leads to global warming.

Effects of Global Warming: rising sea level (due to thermal expansion not melting ice), extreme weather, droughts (famine), and extinctions.

Electricity Generation: steam, from water boiled by fossils fuels or nuclear energy, or falling water is used to turn a generator.

Petroleum (Crude Oil) Formation: microscopic aquatic organisms in sediments converted by heat & pressure into a mixture of hydrocarbons.

Petroleum Pros: cheap, easily transported, high-quality energy. Cons: reserves depleted soon, pollution during drilling, transport and refining, land subsidence, burning oil produces CO 2 .

Coal Formation: prehistoric plants buried un-decomposed in oxygen-depleted water of swamps/bogs converted by heat and pressure.

Ranks of Coal: peat, lignite, bituminous coal, anthracite coal.

PCBs (Polychlorinated Biphenyls): Stable, long-lived, carcinogenic chlorinated hydrocarbons. Produced by the electronics industry.

Multiple Use Public Lands: National Forest & National Resource lands.

Moderately Restricted Use Public Lands: National Wildlife Refuges

Restricted Use Public Lands: National Parks & National Wilderness Preservation System

Rachel Carson: published Silent Spring in 1962; documented the environmental damage done by DDT and other pesticides which heightened public awareness at the start of the modern environmental movement.

John Muir : founded Sierra Club in 1892; fought unsuccessfully to prevent the damming of the Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park.

Gifford Pinchot: first chief of the US Forest Service; advocated managing resources for multiple use using principles of sustainable yield.

Aldo Leopold: wrote A Sand County Almanac published a year after his death in 1948; promoted a "Land Ethic" in which humans are ethically responsible for serving as the protectors of nature.

Sustainable development: the idea that economic improvement for the world's poorest populations is possible without devastating the environment

Ecological footprint : to measure the demands placed on nature by individuals and nations. A simple questionnaire of 16 items gives a rough estimate of your personal footprint.

## Notes

- Social justice is the philosophy that emerged to challenge the unfair distribution of toxic, hazardous, and dangerous waste facilities, which were disproportionately located in low-income communities of color.

- Environmental equality means everyone has an equal say in how we treat out environment.

- A small shift in our climate can have disastrous consequences for humanity in the long term.

- The environmental justice movement dates to the late 1970s and early 1980s when African Americans in Warren County, North Carolina, protested the placement of a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) landfill in their community.

- Warren county was the first example of the term: environmental racism.

- Atrazine is an herbicide used for corn, sugarcane, and turf that ends been proven to end up in human drinking water and is said by some to have negative health effects (which is denied by the EPA).

- Aerosoles are tiny solid and liquid particles suspened in the atmosphere. They affect temperature, cloud formation, and human health (if inhaled).

- Biodiversity in agriculture creates smaller, but healthier yields. It also reduces pests.

- More biodiversity means more resources for innovation, such as the use of spider silk.

## Abstract

The local fishing-based economy of Narsaq, Greenland is greatly suffering. This is the result the migration of shrimps (and the companies that fish them) to northern water. The change in climate has also brought about a melting of the icecaps. This has unearthed many precious earth metals. Some in Narsaq believe that focusing on mining rather than fishing will improve the local economy and hopefully reduce the number of suicides (caused by economic decline). The opposition states that mining will ruin the landscape and that fishing is their tradition.

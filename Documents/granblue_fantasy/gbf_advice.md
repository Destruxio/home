# Spark August 17,2020

I have tried my best to give a holistic view of my current situation on charcters. Summons and weapons aren't included because I'm just trying to get the m1 grids for now. Though, I do still need help with what to do with the grand weapons I got today. 

Please ask if there are other characters not listed that would be good in the party because I may have overlooked them and might have them.

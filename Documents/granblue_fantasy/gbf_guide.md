# Egg's advice for handling weapons

-sell all R weapons (except for +1 weapons)

-reduce all SR gacha weapons
-store all SR farmable weapons for skill foddering

-store all SSR gacha weapons (to be reduced later if they're shit and i need stones, OR to potentially be used in a grid)
-store all SSR farmable weapons for skill foddering

- Travel, living, or working experiences in your own or other communities

- What you would want your future college roommate to know about you

- An intellectual experience (course, project, book, discussion, paper, poetry, or research topic in engineering, mathematics, science or other modes of inquiry) that has meant the most to you

- How you hope to use your college education

- A list of books you have read during the past twelve months
